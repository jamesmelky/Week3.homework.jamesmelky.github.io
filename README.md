# Week3.homework.jamesmelky.github.io
Welcome to my week 3 homework task. 

Here I've created a responsive portfolio in which pages can be toggled and freely moved between one another seamlessly. 

I have used bootstrap and CSS to design the webpage structure and style the html. 

I hope you enjoy marking my work, as much as I have enjoyed creating the content.
